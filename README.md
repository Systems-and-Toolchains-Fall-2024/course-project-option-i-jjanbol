# The benefit of using PostgreSQL DB table compared to a NoSQL Database

PostgreSQL is the better choice in this case because it enforces a clear structure and schema, which is important for working with the highly organized and rigid nature of FIFA data. PostgreSQL also offers good support for data analytics, especially when paired with Spark, making it easy to run complex queries and gain insights from the data.

In contrast, NoSQL databases excel with unstructured or semi-structured data. However, they are less suited for handling complex relational queries or ensuring strict data consistency, which are crucial for structured datasets like FIFA. NoSQL databases are appropriate when the data can be denormalized and schema-less, with a simpler structure, a condition that doesnât apply to FIFA data.

Finally, since FIFA data does not require terabytes of storage or deal with massive-scale operations, the scalability benefits of NoSQL are unnecessary. PostgreSQL, with its support for structured and relational data, is the better solution in this case.

# In your ReadMe file, explain why you chose the classifiers/regressors and provide comments on the impact of the tunable parameters on the accuracy. Also, compare the selected models.

FOR PYTORCH:
We have decided to run MultiLayer Perceptron and Linear regression for PyTorch. 

MultiLayer Perceptron was chosen because fifa dataset is quite complex and has many different features that is relevant to the abilities of the football player. Multilayered approach should be able to learn all the nuance, relationship, and complexities in estimating the Overall rating of a player. It is also likely that these features and target have non-linear relationship, requiring non-linear models such as MLP. This type of model also has great flexibility when it comes to hypertuning. Selection of number of layers to activation function gives the coder much more option than Linear regression model. 

For MLP: With shallow layer depth, the R2 was low and Loss were quite high, indicating that model is not learning well from the data. After adding about 5-6 layers, the model significantly performed better, with each epoch progressively increasin the R2 and decreasing the loss. Dropout of neurons was experimented on the data. However, it hasn't improved the performance on the validation set that much. Hence dropout was not implemented. 

When it comes to Learning rate and Batch size, different values were tried. In the code hyperparameter grid was built to try different values. In general, when lr = 0.1 or higher, model was overshooting and was not stabilizing. Also with SGD, model convergence was very difficult. Thus ADAM was chosen which can introduce much more smoother descent toward local minima than SGD. With lr greater than 0.1, and ADAM as optimizer, convergence became stable and model was learning with decent speed. 

As for Linear regression, there is a possibility that the data points have linear relationship with the target (Overall Rating). If this is the case, we would be able to get a decent Regression model that can predict the Overall rating with decent Loss and R^2 with less computation cost. Linear regression model is foundational yet widely used and can be way cheaper computationally than MLP as it doesn't train multiple layers of functions and perform backpropogation. Linear regression can also have less tendency to overfit when compared to MLP. With many deep layers, MLP is likely to overfit the data. This model is also simple, in that it has fewer parameters to tune and can be setup and run much faster than MLP can. 

For Linear Reg: Since it is simpler model, ADAM was also chosen due to similar reasons with MLP. Similar range of learning rate as well as batch size was tested using hyperparameter grid. 

Overall, MLP resulted R2 â¥ 0.9 which means it is capturing at least 90% of the variance of the testing data which is a good result. The linear reg had R2 â¥ 0.8 which is also decent. When compared to Random Forest regressor which is also in similar range of performance, it is preferred to use in general, Random Forest Regressor, considering the amount of code that needs to be written, hypertuning complexity, and computational cost which is quite high with MLP. 


FOR SPARK:

For the Spark modelling, we decided to use two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.

The reason why both of these models were chosen are:
Linear Regression: This is the most fundamental regression model, usually the starting point for a lot of basic regression problems. It is computationally light and straightforward. It is expected that in the case of the Fifa dataset, a linear regression model will not perform extremely well due to the complexity of the dataset, but we decided to use this as one of the two models to show a contrast between a more "simple" regression model such as this compared to a model that is a lot more complex.

Random Forest Regression: 
By contrast, Random Forest Regression uses multiple decision trees to make predictions, and it is especially suited for datasets that have lots of features, or are very complex relationships. The Fifa dataset has a lot of features we are considering, and the 'overall' value we are trying to predict has a very complex relationship with these features, hence we decided that despite its computational tax, random forest would be a good model to provide accurate predictions for the fifa dataset.

Parameters chosen:

Linear: For linear regression, two parameters were chosen to tune for determining the best performance of the model, which are regParam and maxIter. regParam is the Regularization Parameter, which controls the complexity of the linear model, especially accounting for overfitting. A higher value of regParam poses a larger penalty on overfitting but could cause underfitting, and a lower value of regParam poses more risk of overfitting, but is closer to the training data. The code was designed to use a parameter grid and a cross validator to run multiple parameters at a given time, and so various pairs of values were tested to find the lowest RMSE on the testing data. Values were tasted including 0.5, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001, and the lowest RMSE was found when using a pair of (0.01, 0.0001). A smaller number than 0.0001 gave a slight increase in the error, although it was a very slight increase (in the range of 0.0001s), and similarly a larger value for regParam gave us RMSEs around 2.93.

The second parameter used is maxIter, which is the maximum number of Iterations the optimization algorithm will run before it terminates. Similar to regParam, using too few iterations can cause a poor fit to training data, while too many iterations can lead to overfitting. maxIter values such as 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 100 were run in pairs as mentioned earlier, and the best performance was from the pair of (20, 40). The smaller iterations provided us with a larger RMSE, again around 2.9, and when a pair of (50, 100) were run with the model, it was noted that the RMSE once again increased from the value obtained for (20, 40), which led us to believe that the model was overfitting ad a value of 40 was appropriate.

Using regParam = (0.01, 0.0001) and maxIter = (20, 40), the RMSE was found to be the lowest at 2.8978

Random Forest Regression: For rf regression, three parameters were chosen to tune for the model, which are numTrees, maxDepth, and maxBins. numTrees is the number of decision trees used in the model, which controls the complexity of the forest. More trees would increase the accuracy of the model, but would come with great computational cost. numTrees was varied between 5 to 30, and it was found that 20 provided the best performance while going above that caused the model to incur severe computational costs. The second parameter tuned is maxDepth, which controls the number of splits, or the "depth" a tree in the random forest model can make. An appropriate maxDepth is important as too low of a value causes a lack of complexity in the model, but a large depth can lead to overfitting. A pair of (5, 10) was determined to provide the best RMSE, of which 10 was better performing. Values ranging from 2 till 15 were tested, and this pair gave the best result in terms of RMSE. Below 5 saw a larger error closer to 1.69, and the error increased above a depth of 10 as well, although by a very small magnitude, showing signs of overfitting.

Finally, the last hyperparameter tuned for this model was maxBins, which controls the number of bins used to discretize continuous functions. Similar to maxDepth, too few bins provided less accuracy, but too many bins caused overfitting and high computational cost. Values ranging from 16 to 128 were tested in pairs for this parameter, and the error was minimized when we used (32, 64). Below 32 showed a noticable increase in the error, and when run with 128 bins, the computational cost became very large, and so 64 was determined to be a good limit for this parameter

Using numTrees = (10, 20), maxDepth = (5, 10), and maxBins = (32, 64), the RMSE was found to be the lowest at 1.6702.

Comparing the performance of both models, it can very clearly be noted that the random forest model performed much better than the linear regression model. The Linear regression model had an RMSE around 2.89, which is not bad, especially considering the complex nature of the data and the range of potential values in the overall column. However, it can be concluded that the Random Forest Regression model, which had an RMSE of 1.6702 was much better suited for this task, as it was able to capture the complex relationships between the many features in the dataset, leading to its error performance being better by about 1.2, and did not provide a major computational cost as observed from the PyTorch models
