# The benefit of using PostgreSQL DB table compared to a NoSQL Database

PostgreSQL is the better choice in this case because it enforces a clear structure and schema, which is important for working with the highly organized and rigid nature of FIFA data. PostgreSQL also offers good support for data analytics, especially when paired with Spark, making it easy to run complex queries and gain insights from the data.

In contrast, NoSQL databases excel with unstructured or semi-structured data. However, they are less suited for handling complex relational queries or ensuring strict data consistency, which are crucial for structured datasets like FIFA. NoSQL databases are appropriate when the data can be denormalized and schema-less, with a simpler structure, a condition that doesn’t apply to FIFA data.

Finally, since FIFA data does not require terabytes of storage or deal with massive-scale operations, the scalability benefits of NoSQL are unnecessary. PostgreSQL, with its support for structured and relational data, is the better solution in this case.
